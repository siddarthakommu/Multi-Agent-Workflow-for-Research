# Complex Multi-Agent Workflow for Research

This repository contains a fully functional multi-agent system that automates the process of research paper discovery, summarization, critique, and report generation. It integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and displays the results in a user-friendly Streamlit interface.

## Agent Architecture

Each agent performs a specialized task:

| Agent Name          | Responsibility                                      |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `research_agent`    | Retrieves research papers from arXiv                 |
| `summarization_agent` | Summarizes each retrieved paper                   |
| `critic_agent`      | Provides a critical review of each summary          |
| `writer_agent`      | Assembles a well-structured final report            |

## RAG Pipeline Details

* **Source**: `arxiv` module used to query and download PDFs
* **Embeddings**: `SentenceTransformer (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)`
* **Chunking**: Fixed-size text splitting with overlap
* **Vector DB**: In-memory FAISS or Chroma
* **Retrieval**: Semantic + keyword (hybrid search)
* **LLMs Used**: Gemini/OpenAI (configurable)

## ðŸ“Š Example Output

**Query**: `"Latest advancements in gaming and AI"`

**Output Summary**:

> This report explores recent advancements in the gaming industry using AI, including adaptive difficulty tuning, NPC intelligence, and procedural content generation techniques driven by machine learning.

**Critique**:

> While informative, some summaries were verbose. Multiple papers focused on similar game mechanics without novel angles.

**Structure**:

* Paper Summaries
* AI Methodologies
* Critical Observations
* Key Findings
